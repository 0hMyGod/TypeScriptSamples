## Contributing fixes to existing samples

A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved (Lable: "help wanted") by the TypeScript team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

## Contributing new samples

New samples may be accepted, but will need to first be approved (marked as Lable: "help wanted" by a TypeScript coordinator with the message "Approved") in the suggestion issue. 

For new samples, please provide a detailed explanation of the intended sample, list of technologies or tools used, and an explanation of why existing samples are not sufficient and a new sample is needed.

A new sample should:
* Include a detailed `readme.md` file discribing how to setup, build and run
* Build against a publiclly released version of the TypeScript toolset
* Only include tools/technolgies that serve the main purpose of the sample
* Work cross-platform
