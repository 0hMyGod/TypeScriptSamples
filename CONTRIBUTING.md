## Contributing

## Contributing fixes to existing samples

A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved (labeled "help wanted") by the TypeScript team.
Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing.
If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment on the issue to avoid duplication of effort.

## Contributing new samples

New samples may be accepted, but will need to first be approved (marked "help wanted" by a TypeScript coordinator with the message "Approved") in the suggestion issue. 

For new samples, please provide a detailed explanation of the intended sample, list of technologies or tools used, and an explanation of why existing samples are not sufficient and a new sample is needed.

A new sample should:

* include a detailed `README.md` file describing how to setup, build, and run the sample.
* include a `tsconfig.json`.
* build against a publicly released version of the TypeScript toolset.
* only include tools/technolgies that serve the main purpose of the sample (e.g. no test frameworks unless showcasing a test framework).
* work across all platforms.
